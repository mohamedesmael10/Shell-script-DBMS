# Bash Shell Scripting Database Management System (DBMS)

## Introduction
We, as DEPI trainers, are pleased to announce the completion of a project: a Bash Shell Scripting Database Management System (DBMS) built by [@mohamedesmael10](https://github.com/mohamedesmael10) and [@hadeer-tsu](https://github.com/hadeer-tsu). This project provides a command-line interface (CLI) for creating, managing, and interacting with databases.


## Key Features

### CRUD Operations:
- **Create** databases and tables
- **Read** data from tables using SELECT queries
- **Update** existing data in tables
- **Delete** unwanted data from tables

### Intuitive CLI Menu:
- **Main Menu:**
  - Create a Database
  - List all Databases
  - Connect to a Database
  - Drop a Database
  - Exit
- **Database Menu (after connecting):**
  - Create a Table
  - List all Tables
  - Drop a Table
  - Insert Data into a Table
  - Select Data from a Table (using basic SELECT queries)
  - Delete Data from a Table
  - Update Data in a Table
  - Return to Main Menu

## Data Storage
The DBMS employs a text-based file system approach. Each database is represented by a directory, and tables within that database are stored as separate text files.

## Further Development
Future enhancements could include:
- Integration with external data sources
- Enhanced security features (e.g., user authentication, data encryption)
- Support for more complex data types and queries

## How to Get Started (Optional - for GitHub README)
1. Clone this repository: `https://github.com/mohamedesmael10/Shell-script-DBMS.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Shell-script-DBMS/Data`
3. Make the script executable `chmod +x list.sh`
4. Run the script: `bash list.sh`
